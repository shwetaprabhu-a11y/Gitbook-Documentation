Stop Check & Reorder Check

nFinia Digital Banking Platform

Summerville Federal Credit Union

Product Guide \| April 2026

  ------------------------
  **1. Product Summary**
  ------------------------

Check Services in the nFinia digital banking platform provides You with two essential check management capabilities: Stop Check Payment and Reorder Checks. These features empower credit union You to manage their check-related needs entirely through digital self-service, eliminating the need to call the branch or visit in person.

Stop Check Payment allows You to place a stop payment order on a single check or a series of checks that have been issued but not yet cleared. This is critical for situations involving lost, stolen, or disputed checks. Reorder Checks enables You to place a new checkbook order directly from their digital banking session, pulling verified account details and mailing address from the core system.

Both features are accessible from the More menu hub on the nFinia dashboard, providing a streamlined path for You to manage check services. The platform enforces proper account selection, validates check numbers, and maintains a complete audit trail for compliance purposes.
