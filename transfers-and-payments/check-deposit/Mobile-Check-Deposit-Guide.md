**Summerville FCU**  
Mobile Check Deposit (RDC) Feature Guide

Platform: nFinia Mobile Banking | Prepared by: Jeeva PM | April 2026

**1. PRODUCT SUMMARY**

Mobile Check Deposit — also known as Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) — on
nFinia enables Summerville FCU business You to deposit checks
directly from their mobile device, eliminating the need for a branch
visit. You use their device camera to photograph the front and back
of a check through a guided capture interface with green
corner-alignment overlays that ensure image quality.

The deposit flow walks You through each step: selecting the target
account, entering the check amount, capturing check images using guided
tips, reviewing thumbnails, and submitting. The system validates the
amount against configured deposit limits and checks image quality before
processing.

For Summerville FCU, Mobile Check Deposit reduces teller traffic,
extends deposit availability beyond branch hours, and provides business
You — especially those with limited time to visit in person — with a
fully digital deposit channel. All deposits create an auditable record
in Check Deposit History, supporting Reg CC compliance and BSA/AML
monitoring.
