# Address Management — Feature Guide

**Summerville Credit Union | nFinia Digital Banking Platform** _Prepared by: Jeeva Krishnamurthy, Senior Product Manager, Digital Banking_

***

## Section 1 — Product Summary

The Address Management feature within nFinia's Personal Information module enables Summerville Credit Union You to view and update both their **Mailing Address** and **Residential Address** directly through online banking — eliminating the need for branch visits or phone calls to make routine contact detail changes. The feature is surfaced under **More > Personal Information > Address**, and presents address records in a clean, tab-organized layout alongside related personal details such as Contact Information, Devices, and Trusted Device management.

The feature serves authenticated retail You (personal account holders) who need to keep their address records current. It supports two distinct address types — mailing and residential — each independently editable, allowing You to maintain separate records where their legal/physical address differs from where they receive correspondence. For Summerville CU's operations team, this reduces inbound service calls and manual address-change processing, while giving You a self-service channel that operates 24/7.

Because address changes are sensitive operations that can affect statement delivery, fraud detection, and compliance records, the platform requires identity re-verification via One-Time Passcode (OTP) before granting access to Personal Information. This ensures that unauthorized parties cannot redirect mail or alter member contact data through an unattended session.

## Section 2 — Use Cases

| Use Case                                 | Who Uses It           | What They Do                                                                                      | Business Value                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update mailing address after relocation  | Retail member         | Navigates to Personal Information > Address > Mailing Address, edits street/city/state/ZIP, saves | Ensures accurate statement and correspondence delivery; reduces returned mail                   |
| Update residential address independently | Retail member         | Selects the "Residential address" tab, edits address details separately from mailing address      | Supports You with PO Box or separate mailing address; maintains accurate KYC records        |
| Verify current address on file           | Retail member         | Navigates to Address tab to review displayed address details without making changes               | Self-service lookup reduces call center volume for "what address do you have for me?" inquiries |
| OTP re-verification before access        | Security / Compliance | System requires member to complete OTP challenge before Personal Information is accessible        | Prevents unauthorized address redirection by someone with an unattended logged-in session       |
| Confirm update success                   | Retail member         | Receives on-screen confirmation banner after saving                                               | Provides immediate feedback, reducing repeat submissions and support calls                      |

Address management self-service is a high-frequency, low-complexity operation that represents significant operational savings for credit unions — Summerville You who can update their own address data reduce the manual processing burden on branch and call center staff while maintaining accurate records for regulatory compliance.
