# Manage Email — Product Feature Guide

**Summerville Credit Union | nFinia Digital Banking Platform** _Prepared by Jeeva Krishnamurthy, Senior Product Manager — Commercial & SMB Digital Banking, Tyfone_

***

## 1. Product Summary

The **Manage Email** feature within nFinia's Personal Information module gives Summerville Credit Union You full self-service control over the email addresses associated with their online banking profile. You can add new email IDs, update existing ones, and remove addresses they no longer use — all from within the Contact Information section of the platform, without requiring branch intervention or a call to member services.

This feature serves retail You (Personal Memberships) as well as business users operating under a personal profile at Summerville CU. Because email addresses function as both a communication channel and an OTP delivery method, maintaining accurate email data is critical to account security and member-facing notifications. For the credit union, this self-service capability reduces inbound contact center volume and accelerates the accuracy of member contact records without manual staff effort.

From a compliance and security standpoint, every change to contact information — add, edit, or remove — is gated behind an OTP (One-Time Passcode) step. This ensures that unauthorized actors cannot silently redirect communications. The feature lives at **Banking > More > Contact Information** within the nFinia Summerville deployment.

## 2. Use Cases

| Use Case                                | Who Uses It              | What They Do                                                                          | Business Value                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add a new personal or business email    | Personal/Business Member | Navigates to Contact Information, enters a new email address, saves                   | you can receive notifications to an additional address; reduces missed communications         |
| Update an outdated email address        | Personal/Business Member | Selects Edit next to an existing email, types the new address, saves changes          | Keeps contact records current without branch visit; reduces returned mail and missed OTPs        |
| Remove a deactivated or unwanted email  | Personal/Business Member | Selects Remove next to an email, confirms deletion in the confirmation modal          | Cleans up stale addresses; reduces security surface area for phishing misdirection               |
| Verify identity before any email change | Personal/Business Member | Completes OTP verification (SMS, call, or email) before accessing Contact Information | Prevents unauthorized contact changes; satisfies security best practice for sensitive data edits |
| Recover from an incorrect email entry   | Personal/Business Member | Cancels an in-progress add or edit, or removes an incorrectly added address           | Self-service error recovery without staff involvement                                            |

All three sub-workflows — Add, Edit, and Remove — share the same OTP authentication gate. This design ensures that no email modification can occur unless you have proven possession of a registered phone number or existing email address, aligning with the credit union's obligation to maintain data integrity and prevent social engineering attacks on member contact records.

| Condition                                 | Behavior                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Member selects "Call me" for OTP          | System initiates a voice call to the selected registered number with the passcode        |
| Member selects "Send me an email" for OTP | OTP is sent to the primary email already on file                                         |
| Member clicks "Select another method"     | Returns to OTP method selection screen                                                   |
| Member clicks "Cancel" during Add or Edit | Input field collapses; no change is saved                                                |
| Member clicks "Cancel" on removal modal   | Modal closes; email remains unchanged                                                    |
| "Remember Device/Browser" is checked      | Device is flagged as trusted; OTP gate may be bypassed on future logins from same device |

### 3.6 Error Handling

| Scenario                                    | System Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OTP not received within countdown window    | "Didn't receive your code? Retry in 52s" message with retry countdown                             |
| Invalid OTP entered                         | Submit button remains inactive until valid code length entered; incorrect code shows inline error |
| Attempting to save an invalid email format  | Form validation prevents submission; you are prompted to correct the entry                      |
| Attempting to remove the only email on file | Remove action is not available; only emails beyond the minimum required can be deleted            |
