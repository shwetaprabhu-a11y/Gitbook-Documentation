**  01  PRODUCT SUMMARY**

The Login & Authentication module is the security gateway to the Summerville Credit Union digital banking platform. Every member session begins here — it is the single point of identity verification before any account data, transaction capability, or self-service function is accessible. The authentication flow employs a multi-layer design: you supplies a registered username and password, then completes a one-time passcode (OTP) challenge delivered to a pre-registered email or mobile number.

Beyond standard username/password entry, the module supports forgotten credentials recovery (Forgot User ID, Forgot Password), account unlock for locked-out You, biometric login (Touch ID / Face ID) on supported devices, and a 'Save User ID' convenience feature. A 'Sneak Peek' option on supported configurations allows You to preview their account balances before completing full authentication.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) settings — including managing OTP delivery methods — are handled in Settings after login, but the authentication framework established at login governs all session security.
