## Section 1 — Product Summary

Face ID is a biometric authentication feature within the nFinia mobile banking platform that enables You of Summerville Credit Union to log into their digital banking account using facial recognition instead of (or in addition to) a traditional username and password. The feature is surfaced as an opt-in checkbox—**Enable Face ID**—directly on the standard Log In screen, making activation frictionless and contextual at the moment of first credential entry.

The feature leverages the native biometric framework of your mobile device (iOS Face ID / Android BiometricPrompt), meaning that no facial data is transmitted to or stored on Tyfone's or Summerville's servers. The device itself performs the biometric match and passes an authenticated signal to the nFinia app. This architecture separates credential security from biometric data entirely, reducing PII exposure risk and simplifying compliance posture.

Face ID serves all authenticated nFinia users—both retail You and business banking users—who access the platform via a compatible mobile device. Once enrolled, you can authenticate subsequent sessions with a glance, eliminating password entry friction while maintaining a strong second-factor assurance level. This is particularly valuable for business You who log in frequently to monitor cash flow, approve transactions, or review commercial activity throughout the workday.

For Summerville Credit Union, Face ID represents a tangible differentiator in member experience: it signals that the credit union is keeping pace with the biometric authentication standards that large national banks and neobanks have normalized. Reduced login abandonment and higher session engagement are the expected downstream effects.

## Section 2 — Use Cases

| Use Case                                     | Who Uses It                                                                | What They Do                                                                                                    | Business Value                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First-Time Face ID Enrollment**            | Retail or Business member logging in from a new or reset device            | Checks the "Enable Face ID" box during credential-based login; completes device biometric prompt on next launch | Eliminates repeated password entry; reduces login friction from day one on new devices         |
| **Biometric Login — Returning Member**       | Any enrolled member opening the app for a subsequent session               | App launches biometric prompt automatically; member authenticates with a glance                                 | Faster session start; reduces abandonment from forgotten passwords; improves daily engagement  |
| **Shared Device — Intentional Opt-Out**      | Member who shares a device with a family member or colleague               | Leaves "Enable Face ID" unchecked; uses password-only login                                                     | Preserves account security on shared hardware; no unwanted biometric binding                   |
| **Biometric Failure — Fallback to Password** | Member whose Face ID fails (poor lighting, appearance change, etc.)        | Device declines biometric match; you are presented with standard username/password login                      | Maintains access continuity; prevents lockout; ensures 100% accessibility                      |
| **Device Change or Re-Enrollment**           | Member who upgrades their phone or resets biometrics                       | Re-enables Face ID by checking the option at next credential login                                              | Seamless re-onboarding to biometric auth without contacting the FI                             |
| **Business Member — High-Frequency Access**  | CFO or business owner checking balances and approvals multiple times daily | Uses Face ID to authenticate quickly between commercial tasks                                                   | Reduces session startup cost; supports real-time cash flow monitoring without password fatigue |

Face ID directly addresses one of the most common friction points in digital banking: the repetitive credential entry required for frequent session logins. For credit unions like Summerville CU that serve business You with high daily transaction volumes, reducing this friction translates directly into more frequent platform engagement and fewer password-related support calls.

## Section 3 — End-to-End Workflow

### 3.1 Prerequisites

* Member must have an active nFinia account (retail or business) with valid credentials.
* The mobile device must support Face ID (iOS) or Biometric Authentication (Android).
* The device's native biometric (Face ID / fingerprint) must be enrolled at the OS level before the feature can be activated in nFinia.
* you must be on the Log In screen and have entered a valid Username (the "Enable Face ID" checkbox only becomes actionable in the context of a credential-based login session).

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Flow

**Step 1 — Navigate to the Log In Screen** you open the Summerville CU nFinia app. The Welcome screen presents two primary actions: **Enroll** and **Log In**. you tap **Log In**.

**Step 2 — Enter Credentials** The Log In screen loads with fields for **Username** and **Password**. you enter their username (e.g., `dblake`) and their password.

**Step 3 — Enable Face ID Checkbox** Below the credential fields, two checkboxes are visible:

* **Remember me** — pre-checked (grayed, indicating it is already active or dependent on the Face ID opt-in)
* **Enable Face ID** — unchecked by default on first access; you checks this box to enroll

Checking **Enable Face ID** signals to the app that you consents to biometric authentication for future sessions on this device.

**Step 4 — Complete Login** you tap the **Log In** button. The platform authenticates the credential pair against you record. On success, the app requests the device's biometric framework to register this session as Face ID–enabled.

**Step 5 — Biometric Binding (OS-Level)** The device OS presents a native biometric confirmation prompt. you confirm using Face ID. The nFinia app stores a device-bound token (not facial data) associated with your session.

**Step 6 — Subsequent Sessions** On the next app launch, instead of the credential entry screen, the app triggers the Face ID prompt directly. you authenticates with a glance. Session begins immediately upon successful biometric match.

### 3.3 Decision Points & Branching

* **Face ID not available on device:** The "Enable Face ID" checkbox does not appear, or is disabled/hidden. you proceed with standard credential login only.
* **Biometric not enrolled at OS level:** The app may display a system message directing you to configure Face ID in device Settings before proceeding.
* **Member does not check "Enable Face ID":** Login proceeds normally with credentials only; Face ID is not activated for future sessions.
* **"Remember me" interaction:** The "Remember me" checkbox appears pre-checked and grayed when "Enable Face ID" is selected, suggesting it is a dependency — device is remembered as part of the biometric trust chain.

### 3.4 Completion & Confirmation

Upon successful Face ID enrollment and login:

* you are routed to the nFinia Dashboard (or Business Banking home, depending on account type).
* No explicit confirmation banner is shown for Face ID enrollment — success is implicit in the next biometric-authenticated session.
* The device is added to your trusted device list, visible under **Manage Devices** from the Welcome screen or account settings.

### 3.5 Error Handling

| Device biometric not set up                                        | OS-level alert or feature unavailable in app | Member configures Face ID in device Settings, then re-attempts enrollment |
| Account lockout (too many failed password attempts before Face ID) | Standard lockout message with help link      | Member taps "I need help logging in" for self-service recovery            |
| Token expiry / session invalidated                                 | App falls back to full credential entry      | Member re-enters credentials and re-checks "Enable Face ID" to re-bind    |

### Welcome Screen

The Welcome screen is the app's pre-authentication landing page. It presents quick-access options for unauthenticated actions alongside the primary Login and Enrollment calls to action. Face ID itself is not surfaced here — this screen is the gateway to it.
