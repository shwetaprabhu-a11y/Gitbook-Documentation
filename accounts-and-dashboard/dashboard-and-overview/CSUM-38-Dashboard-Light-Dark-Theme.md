**Dashboard -- Light & Dark Theme**

Feature Delivery Guide

Summerville Federal Credit Union \| nFinia Platform \| April 2026

  ------------------------
  **1. Product Summary**
  ------------------------

The Dashboard Light & Dark Theme feature provides Summerville Federal Credit Union You with the ability to switch their nFinia Online Banking dashboard between a Light Mode and a Dark Mode visual appearance. This personalization option allows You to choose the interface aesthetic that best suits their preference, environment, and accessibility needs.

Light Mode presents the dashboard with a clean, open feel---white and light blue backgrounds, high-contrast dark text, and soft card shadows. Dark Mode transforms the entire interface into a deep navy-purple palette with vibrant accent colors, reducing eye strain in low-light environments while maintaining full readability and feature parity. Every dashboard widget, navigation element, account tile, sidebar link, and footer section adapts seamlessly to the selected theme.

The theme toggle is available to all authenticated You and persists across sessions. It applies to the full post-login experience including the Account Overview, Quick Transfer widget, Credit Score meter, Related Links sidebar, and footer. This feature positions Summerville FCU as a modern, member-centric institution that prioritizes digital experience quality alongside functional banking capabilities.

  **3. End-to-End Workflow**
  ----------------------------

**3.1 Prerequisites**

• Member must have an active online banking enrollment with Summerville FCU

• Theme support must be enabled at the FI configuration level (nFinia Admin)

• Compatible browser or device with CSS dark-mode rendering support

**3.2 Step-by-Step Flow**

**Step 1 -- Dashboard (Light Mode):** Member logs into nFinia Online Banking and lands on the Account Overview dashboard in Light Mode (default). The interface presents a clean, white and light-blue color scheme with the Summerville wave logo, navigation bar (Dashboard, Accounts, Move Money, More), account balance tiles with dark navy headers, Quick Transfer widget, Upcoming Payments section, Credit Score meter, and Related Links sidebar. The footer displays branch information, contact details, and compliance logos against a light background.

**Step 2 -- Dashboard (Dark Mode):** Member toggles the theme to Dark Mode. The entire dashboard transforms to a deep navy-purple palette. Account tiles use vibrant gradient backgrounds, the navigation bar and header shift to dark tones with bright accent text, the Quick Transfer widget and Credit Score meter adapt their backgrounds and text colors for dark-mode readability, and the footer transitions to a matching dark scheme. All functionality remains identical---only the visual presentation changes. Balances, links, widgets, and actions are all fully accessible in both themes.

**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

• Theme selection persists across sessions via user preference stored server-side; you does not need to re-select on each login.

• If the FI has not enabled Dark Mode at the configuration level, only Light Mode is available and no toggle is displayed.

• Both themes maintain identical navigation paths, widget layouts, and feature access---no functionality is lost or altered by theme selection.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

Theme switching is instant with no page reload required. The system applies the new color palette via CSS class toggling. you see an immediate visual transition. The preference is saved automatically and reflected on the next login.

**3.5 Error Handling**

• If the browser does not support CSS custom properties (very rare in modern browsers), the system falls back to Light Mode.

• If the preference save fails, the theme reverts to the default on next login but the current session remains in the selected theme.

• No destructive errors are possible as theme switching is purely cosmetic.
