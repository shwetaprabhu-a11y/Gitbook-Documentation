  **1. Product Summary**
  ------------------------

Certificate Management is a core feature of the nFinia Digital Banking platform that enables credit union You to manage their investment certificate (CD) accounts directly through the digital banking portal. This capability allows You to renew certificates, hold balances without renewal, and close certificates at maturity --- all without visiting a branch or calling the contact center.

Within the Summerville Federal Credit Union digital banking portal, Certificate Management is accessible from the Account Details page via the "Manage Certificate" link on any eligible investment account. The feature provides a guided, step-by-step workflow for each maturity option: renewing the certificate for the same or a different term, holding the balance in a non-accruing state, or transferring the balance to a checking or savings account upon maturity.

For Summerville FCU, Certificate Management reduces operational burden on branch staff by enabling self-service certificate lifecycle management. You benefit from 24/7 access to manage their investment accounts on their own schedule, with clear review screens and confirmation steps that ensure informed decision-making. The feature supports Ultra Data core integration and is configured through the nFinia platform's system configuration framework.

  ----------------------------
  **3. End-to-End Workflow**
  ----------------------------

**3.1 Prerequisites**

• Member must be enrolled in Summerville FCU digital banking with an active membership.

• you must hold at least one eligible Investment account (Product ID type "I" in Ultra Data core).

• The Certificate Management feature must be enabled in the FI's system configuration (MANAGE_CERTIFICATE_CONFIG).

• The certificate must be within its maturity management window for renewal, hold, or closure options to appear.

**3.2 Step-by-Step Workflow**

**Step 1: View Certificate on Account Details**

![](/.gitbook/assets/ecf7fd81a0106ba3cb8422c1d9045df07d6a4a7c.png){width="4.416666666666667in" height="0.7083333333333334in"}

you log into the Summerville FCU digital banking portal and navigates to their Account Details page for the investment certificate. The page displays key certificate information including Current Balance, Interest Rate, Term (in days), and Maturity Date. A "Manage Certificate" link is prominently displayed, providing the single entry point to all certificate management actions.

**Step 2: Manage Certificate Options**

![](/.gitbook/assets/c8c988948de3b52730ceacd99431a2e2a8843970.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.729166666666667in"}

Clicking "Manage Certificate" presents the available maturity options configured for this certificate. The options include Renew Certificate (reinvest the full balance or rollover to a new product), Hold Balance Without Renewing (keep funds in account without accruing additional interest), and Close at Maturity (transfer balance to another account). The available options are determined by the MANAGE_CERTIFICATE_CONFIG system configuration and the core system's availableMaturityOptions response.

**Step 3: Renew Certificate --- Select Renewal Option**

![](/.gitbook/assets/575cf0cd493eb7949a8d5815242572f5bd1e6ad6.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.885416666666667in"}

When you select Renew Certificate, they are presented with renewal options in a guided stepper workflow. Step 1 asks you to choose between renewing the existing certificate (reinvest full balance at current or new term) or reinvesting/rolling over to a new certificate product. The current maturity option is pre-selected based on the currentMaturityOption API response. If you select Reinvest or Rollover, additional fields appear for selecting the rollover product and specifying a partial withdrawal amount.

**Step 4: Select Term**

![](/.gitbook/assets/669585442174622e38b603264d9541d2ca0642f3.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.833333333333333in"}

In Step 2 of the renewal flow, you select the term for the renewed certificate. For Ultra Data core, the term is entered as a number of days with minimum and maximum validation based on the availableReinvestTerms API response (minTerm and maxTerm values). For Correlation core, terms are presented as a dropdown selection. you review the selected term and clicks Next to proceed to the review screen.

**Step 5: Review Renewal Details**

![](/.gitbook/assets/24f456174cd789add3372fab19c384fad68c176c.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="6.114583333333333in"}

The Review screen presents a comprehensive summary of the renewal configuration: the certificate account, selected renewal option, chosen term, current balance, interest rate, and maturity date. you can click Back to modify any selection (all previously entered data is retained) or click Renew to submit the renewal request to the core banking system.

**Step 6: Renewal Success**

![](/.gitbook/assets/fe703babde4b4a33949d29e04ce60fed688fe00b.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.65625in"}

Upon successful submission, the system displays a confirmation screen with the renewal details and a success message. The screen includes a reference number for the transaction and a link to return to the Accounts page. If the renewal fails due to a recoverable error, a retry option is presented. Customer support contact information is displayed for non-recoverable errors.

**Step 7: Hold Balance Without Renewing**

![](/.gitbook/assets/b98be393a3c5f9cea5235173d5fb3503ad024201.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.770833333333333in"}

When you select Hold Balance Without Renewing, the system presents a confirmation screen explaining that the certificate will not be renewed and the balance will remain in the account without accruing additional interest post-maturity. you must accept the Terms and Conditions via a checkbox before the Submit button becomes active. This ensures informed consent and creates an audit trail of your decision.

**Step 8: Hold Balance Success**

![](/.gitbook/assets/7e1a6c25cc3eb8257cfea0e0382c24f292b6fbf9.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.770833333333333in"}

After accepting the terms and submitting, the system confirms the hold request with a success screen. The balance remains accessible and you retains the option to renew the certificate at a later date, transfer the balance, or withdraw funds without penalty.

**Step 9: Close at Maturity**

![](/.gitbook/assets/eb74ebde9fa15467ce03d3f776ca08c93aebe26a.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.21875in"}

When you select Close at Maturity, they are prompted to select a transfer-to account (filtered to eligible Checking, Savings, or Loan accounts based on the accountConfigs and memberConfigs configuration). An optional reason selector is displayed if IS_CLOSE_CERTIFICATE_REASON_MANDATORY is configured; selecting "Other" reveals a free-text input field. you must accept the Terms and Conditions before submitting the closure request.

**Step 10: Close at Maturity Success**

![](/.gitbook/assets/a33297f340a1a2f1327dda3fa8729d45f6493e2a.png){width="6.458333333333333in" height="5.770833333333333in"}

The system confirms the certificate closure with a success screen showing the transfer details, destination account, and a reference number. The certificate balance is transferred to the selected account and the certificate account is marked for closure.

**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

The Certificate Management workflow includes several decision points that affect the user journey:

• Renewal Option Selection: Choosing "Renew existing certificate" follows a straightforward term selection flow. Choosing "Reinvest or Rollover" adds an additional step to select the target certificate product from rolloverTypeList and optionally specify a partial withdrawal amount.

• Partial Withdrawal: If you opts to withdraw a portion of the balance during rollover, the system validates the amount against minimum and maximum thresholds and requires selection of an eligible transfer-to account.

• Core System Variation: Ultra Data presents term selection as a free-text day input with min/max validation. Correlation presents terms as a dropdown selection. The widgetType configuration key controls which input is displayed.

• Closure Reason: The reason field on Close at Maturity is optional or required based on IS_CLOSE_CERTIFICATE_REASON_MANDATORY configuration. Reasons are maintained in nFinia configs and tracked in Harmoney for analytics.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

All three workflows (Renew, Hold Balance, Close at Maturity) conclude with a confirmation screen that includes: a success/failure status message, transaction reference number, summary of the action taken, customer support contact information, and a navigation link to return to the Accounts page. Successful transactions generate an audit log entry and may trigger member notifications depending on the FI's alert configuration.

**3.5 Error Handling**

Common failure scenarios include: invalid term entry (outside minTerm/maxTerm range) which triggers inline validation, withdrawal amount exceeding available balance which displays an error message, core system timeout which presents a retry option, and Terms & Conditions not accepted which keeps the Submit button disabled. For non-recoverable errors, the system displays customer support contact information and a reference ID for troubleshooting.

  **5. Conclusion**
  -------------------

Certificate Management is a critical self-service capability for Summerville Federal Credit Union's digital banking offering on the nFinia platform. The feature addresses a fundamental gap in you experience by enabling account holders to manage the full lifecycle of their investment certificates --- from renewal and rollover to balance holds and maturity closures --- without requiring branch visits or phone calls.

The guided stepper workflow with clear review screens and Terms & Conditions acceptance ensures You make informed decisions while creating the audit trail required for regulatory compliance. The configurable architecture --- driven by MANAGE_CERTIFICATE_CONFIG and core system API responses --- allows Summerville FCU to tailor the available options to their product strategy and core system capabilities. The Ultra Data core integration is fully supported in the current release, with Correlation core support planned for future iterations.

For Summerville FCU, Certificate Management strengthens member retention by providing the digital convenience that today's You expect. You who can easily renew their certificates online are more likely to keep their deposits with the credit union rather than shopping competitor rates. The feature reduces operational costs by deflecting routine certificate management inquiries from the contact center and branch staff, allowing them to focus on higher-value advisory interactions.
