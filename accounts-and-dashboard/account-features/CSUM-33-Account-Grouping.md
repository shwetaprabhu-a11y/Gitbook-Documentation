**1. Product Summary**

The Custom Account Grouping feature within the nFinia digital banking platform enables You to organize their accounts into personalized groups and sections on the Accounts Overview screen. By default, the platform displays accounts in system-defined groups such as Deposit Accounts and Loan Accounts. With Custom Account Grouping, You can create their own groups (e.g., \'Family Savings,\' \'Business Accounts,\' \'Vacation Fund\'), add sections within groups for further categorization, move accounts between groups, and reorder groups to match their personal financial management preferences.

This feature serves all digital banking You --- from individual consumers managing personal finances to business owners organizing multiple operating and reserve accounts. For credit unions, Custom Account Grouping delivers a highly personalized self-service experience that increases member engagement with the platform, reduces friction in account navigation, and differentiates the digital banking offering from competitors that rely on rigid, system-defined account structures.

The feature is accessible from the Accounts Overview screen via the Account Group dropdown. You can switch between the default \'All Accounts\' view and any custom groups they have created. The Manage Groups interface provides full control over group creation, editing, deletion, section management, account assignment, and group sort order. Released in nFinia version 10.44, this feature is part of the platform\'s ongoing personalization strategy.

These use cases highlight how Custom Account Grouping transforms the Accounts Overview from a static, system-defined list into a personalized financial dashboard. For Summerville FCU, this personalization capability is a key differentiator that increases digital banking stickiness, reduces the likelihood of You switching to competitor platforms, and demonstrates the credit union\'s commitment to member-centric design.

**3. End-to-End Workflow**

**3.1 Prerequisites**

- Member must be enrolled in nFinia digital banking with active credentials.

- Member must have at least one linked account (deposit, loan, or credit card).

- Custom Account Grouping feature must be enabled by the financial institution (available from nFinia release 10.44).

**3.2 Step-by-Step Flow**

Step 1: Member logs into nFinia digital banking and lands on the Dashboard. The account overview displays all linked accounts including checking, savings, loan, and credit card accounts with current balances.

![](/.gitbook/assets/24c30f617e73e6629d17809c27be42eacd3ba8fb.png){width="3.75in" height="5.885416666666667in"}

The Dashboard provides you\'s full account portfolio at a glance. From here, you navigate to the Accounts section to access the Account Grouping feature.

Step 2: Member navigates to the Accounts Overview screen. The Account Group dropdown at the top of the screen defaults to \'All Accounts,\' showing all linked accounts in system-defined groups (Deposit Accounts, Loan Accounts, etc.).

![](/.gitbook/assets/a945ccfd28f58814a3e6f42105ca7f1d041affeb.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="2.5625in"}

The Account Group dropdown reveals all available groups --- both system-defined and any custom groups you have created. Selecting a group filters the Accounts Overview to show only accounts within that group. The \'Manage Groups\' option at the bottom of the dropdown opens the group management interface.

Step 3: Member selects \'Manage Groups\' from the dropdown or navigates to the group management screen. To create a new custom group, you tap the \'New Custom Group\' option. The system displays an empty group creation form.

![](/.gitbook/assets/04108ad58b03fea0bc4487ee60b7078f425d26d4.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="2.4583333333333335in"}

The New Custom Group form presents fields for the group name and allows you to add sections and accounts. The form starts empty, ready for you to define their custom organizational structure.

Step 4: Member fills in the group details --- enters a Group Name (e.g., \'BanC3 Business Profile\'), adds sections, and selects accounts to include in the group.

![](/.gitbook/assets/6dc0deac0d36ee7134f87c17788efd355f2170c0.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="2.46875in"}

The completed form shows the group name, any sections created within the group, and the accounts assigned. Each account displays its name and current balance. you can add multiple sections and distribute accounts across sections for granular organization.

Step 5: When adding accounts, you uses the \'Add Account\' dropdown to select from all available accounts not yet assigned to this group.

![](/.gitbook/assets/6e0099bf3bcf548dccb3333c52f88d252338be3e.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="2.46875in"}

The Add Account dropdown lists all eligible accounts with their names and masked account numbers. you select one or more accounts to add to the current group or section. Accounts can belong to multiple custom groups simultaneously.

Step 6: To modify a system-defined group, you select \'Edit\' on an existing system group (e.g., Deposit Accounts). The system displays the group\'s current configuration with options to add sections, move accounts, or rename sections.

![](/.gitbook/assets/7092a724a8094dc0630e22de9ddc6ba0f6d52103.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="2.46875in"}

The Edit System Group view shows the group\'s current accounts and sections. You can add new sections within system groups to further organize their default account view. System group names cannot be changed, but their internal structure is fully customizable.

Step 7: To edit a custom group, you select \'Edit\' on their custom group. The full group configuration is displayed with options to rename, add/remove sections, add/remove accounts, or delete the group entirely.

![](/.gitbook/assets/acd46680f36cd2ec736de44aafd4c25519d7c442.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="2.8333333333333335in"}

The Edit Custom Group view provides full CRUD operations: rename the group, add or remove sections, move accounts between sections, add new accounts via the dropdown, or delete the entire group. Changes are saved when you confirm the edit.

Step 8: To reorder groups, you access the Manage Groups sort interface. Groups are displayed in a sortable list with drag handles, allowing you to arrange groups in their preferred display order.

![](/.gitbook/assets/abc75d9ba70e8c0897886de81e977d764c73b9b7.png){width="5.833333333333333in" height="2.3854166666666665in"}

The Manage Groups sort page shows all groups (both system and custom) in their current display order. you can drag and drop groups to rearrange them. The sort order determines the sequence in which groups appear in the Account Group dropdown and on the Accounts Overview screen.

**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

- If you have no custom groups, the Account Group dropdown shows only system-defined groups and the \'Manage Groups\' option.

- If you attempts to delete a custom group that contains accounts, the system prompts for confirmation and moves accounts back to the default \'All Accounts\' view.

- System groups cannot be deleted or renamed, only their internal sections and account arrangement can be modified.

- If you create a section within a group, accounts can be moved between sections via drag-and-drop or the Move Account action.

- If no accounts are assigned to a custom group, the group appears empty but remains visible in the dropdown.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

Upon saving a new or edited group, the system persists the configuration and returns you to the Accounts Overview with the updated grouping applied. The Account Group dropdown immediately reflects the new or modified group. No notifications or audit log entries are generated as this is a presentation-layer personalization feature with no transactional impact.

**3.5 Error Handling**

- Duplicate group name: The system prevents saving a custom group with a name that already exists and displays an inline validation error.

- Empty group name: The system requires a group name before saving and highlights the field with a validation message.

- Session timeout during editing: Unsaved changes are lost; you are redirected to login. The system does not auto-save partial group configurations.

- Maximum group limit: If the financial institution has configured a maximum number of custom groups, the system disables the \'New Custom Group\' option and displays a message indicating the limit has been reached.

**6. Conclusion**

The Custom Account Grouping feature delivers a personalized account management experience for Summerville FCU You, transforming the Accounts Overview from a static, system-defined list into a flexible, member-controlled financial dashboard. By enabling custom groups, sections, account assignment, and sort ordering, the platform empowers You to organize their financial lives in ways that match their personal or business needs.

Key benefits for Summerville FCU include increased digital banking engagement through personalization, reduced member friction when navigating complex account portfolios, and competitive differentiation against platforms that offer only rigid account views. The feature\'s intuitive group management interface --- with support for both system group customization and fully custom groups --- ensures accessibility for all member segments, from individual consumers to business owners with dozens of accounts.

Future enhancements may include shared group templates for business accounts (allowing an admin to define groups visible to authorized signers), group-level aggregate balance displays, smart group suggestions based on account activity patterns, and cross-device sync for group configurations across web and mobile channels.
