**1. Product Summary**

The Reward Points & Credit Card Management module within the nFinia digital banking platform provides credit union You with comprehensive visibility into their credit card accounts and associated reward programs. You can view credit card balances, available credit, payment due dates, and total amounts owed directly from their account dashboard. The reward points subsystem surfaces earned, available, redeemed, and expiring point balances at a glance, enabling You to make timely redemption decisions before points expire.

This feature serves individual and business You who hold credit card products issued through Summerville Federal Credit Union. It integrates with the card processor to display real-time card status (Active/Locked/Unlocked), linked card numbers, and cardholder names. For credit unions, offering a transparent, self-service reward points experience directly within the digital banking platform reduces call center volume, increases card engagement, and strengthens member loyalty by making reward value immediately visible and actionable.

The module lives under the Accounts section of nFinia. You access it by selecting their credit card account from the account overview. The reward points detail is available both inline on the credit card account page and via a dedicated Reward Points popup modal that provides a tabular breakdown of all linked cards and their individual reward balances.

**3.2 Step-by-Step Flow**

The Dashboard shows you\'s full account portfolio at a glance. Credit card accounts are listed alongside deposit accounts, displaying the current balance. you can navigate to specific features through the top navigation bar or the More menu hub at the bottom of the page.

Step 2: Member taps the \'More\' option from the bottom navigation or the +More menu link. The More Menu Hub opens, displaying a grid of all available banking features organized by category.

The More Menu Hub provides a centralized navigation point for features beyond the primary tabs. You can access Cards, Check Services, Reward Points, Skip-a-Pay, and other account management features from this hub. you select the credit card account or navigates to the Cards section to access reward points.

Step 3: Member selects the credit card account (e.g., \'P-Money\'s Credit Card (\#160)\') from the Accounts section. The system navigates to the Credit Card Account Detail view showing the full card summary and reward points balance.

The Credit Card Account Detail screen displays: card image and name, credit limit (\$5,000.00), available credit (\$1,241.67), payment due date and amount, total due (\$3,758.33). Below the summary, the \'Cards in this account\' section shows linked card numbers (masked), card type (Visa Signature), cardholder name, and lock/unlock status toggle. The Reward Points summary row shows Earned to Date (3,914 points), Rewards Points Available (57,496), Redeemed to Date (0 points), and Expiring Points (58 points on 04/30/2025).

Step 4: Member clicks \'Redeem/View\' link to open the Reward Points modal for detailed information and card-level breakdown.

The Reward Points modal displays a card-level breakdown: card number (masked), status (ACTIVE), cardholder name (PERCIVAL F CEREZO), and a Redeem/View action link. The summary header shows: Earned to Date (0 points for current period), Rewards Points Available (3,000), Redeemed to Date (-2,500), and Expiring Points (3,000 on 11/30/2028).

Step 5: Member clicks \'Redeem/View\' within the modal to navigate to the card processor\'s reward redemption interface or an embedded redemption workflow.

**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

- If you have no credit card products, the credit card section does not appear in the Accounts view.

- If the reward points program is not enabled on the card, the reward points row is hidden.

- If the card is locked, you see \'Locked\' status and must unlock before certain card actions are available.

- If points are expiring soon, the expiring points count and date are highlighted to prompt action.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

Upon viewing reward points, no system state changes occur (read-only operation). When a member initiates a redemption through the Redeem/View link, the system routes to the card processor\'s redemption flow. Upon successful redemption, the Redeemed to Date counter increments and Available Points decreases accordingly. you receive a confirmation notification within the nFinia Inbox.

**3.5 Error Handling**

- Card processor unavailable: The system displays \'Reward points information is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.\' The credit card balance information remains visible from cached data.

- Insufficient points for redemption: The redemption interface validates the minimum point threshold and prevents submission with an inline error message.

- Session timeout during redemption: you are redirected to login; partial redemptions are not processed.

**6. Conclusion**

The Reward Points & Credit Card Management module delivers a self-service, transparent experience for Summerville FCU You to manage their credit card accounts and maximize the value of their reward programs. By integrating real-time card data, reward balances, and redemption capabilities directly into the nFinia digital banking platform, the credit union eliminates the need for You to navigate separate card processor portals or contact the call center for routine reward inquiries.

Key benefits for Summerville FCU include reduced operational costs from fewer inbound calls about reward balances, increased credit card engagement through visibility of available and expiring points, and strengthened member loyalty through a unified digital experience. The PCI-DSS compliant card masking and TILA-aligned disclosure of credit terms ensure regulatory compliance while maintaining a member-friendly interface.

Future enhancements may include push notifications for expiring points, reward point projections based on spending patterns, and one-click redemption for statement credits directly within the nFinia platform.
