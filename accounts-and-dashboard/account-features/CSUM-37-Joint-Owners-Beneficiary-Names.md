**Accounts -- Joint Owners & Beneficiary Names**

Feature Delivery Guide

Summerville Federal Credit Union \| nFinia Platform \| April 2026

  ------------------------
  **1. Product Summary**
  ------------------------

The Joint Owners & Beneficiary Names feature enhances the Account Detail view in nFinia Online Banking by displaying all account holders and designated beneficiaries directly on the account summary page. Previously, members could only view their own name on the account; with this enhancement, Primary Holders, Joint Holders, and Beneficiaries are listed with their respective roles clearly labeled beneath each name.

This feature serves all retail and business members who hold joint accounts or have designated beneficiaries on deposit accounts. It is particularly valuable for credit unions like Summerville Federal Credit Union, where family membership and multi-owner accounts represent a significant portion of the membership base. By surfacing this information in the digital channel, members no longer need to call or visit a branch to confirm account ownership details.

The feature is accessible from the Account Detail page within the Accounts module. When a member clicks on any account from the Account Overview dashboard, the detail page now includes an expandable \"All Account Holders\" section showing every holder and beneficiary associated with that account. This drives transparency, reduces operational call volume, and supports regulatory compliance by ensuring members can verify account ownership information digitally.

  **3. End-to-End Workflow**
  ----------------------------

**3.1 Prerequisites**

• Member must have an active online banking enrollment with Summerville FCU

• Account must have at least one additional holder or beneficiary configured in the core system

• Feature must be enabled at the FI configuration level (nFinia Admin)

**3.2 Step-by-Step Flow**

**Step 1 -- Dashboard (Account Overview):** Member logs into nFinia Online Banking and lands on the Account Overview dashboard. All enrolled memberships and accounts are displayed as tile cards showing account type, balance, and last activity.

*Figure 1: Summerville FCU -- Account Overview Dashboard*

**Step 2 -- Account Detail (Joint Owners & Beneficiary View):** Member clicks on a specific account tile (e.g., Savings Account) to open the Account Detail page. The page displays account balances (Available, Current, Minimum), quick action links (Internal Transfer, See More), and the All Account Holders section. Expanding this section reveals each holder with their role: Primary Holder, Joint Holder, or Beneficiary. The right sidebar provides related links including Change Password, Account Settings, Download E-Statements, and more.

**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

• If the account has no additional holders or beneficiaries, the All Account Holders section displays only the primary holder name.

• If the member is a Joint Holder (not Primary), they see the same holder list but cannot modify ownership.

• The feature is read-only; no editing of holder/beneficiary information is possible through the digital channel. Changes must be made through branch or back-office operations.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

This is a view-only feature with no transactional confirmation. The member simply views the account holder information. The data is sourced in real-time from the core banking system, ensuring accuracy. No notifications or audit log entries are generated for viewing this information.

**3.5 Error Handling**

• If the core system is unavailable, the All Account Holders section may display a loading indicator or fallback message.

• If holder data is incomplete in the core, the field may show the holder name without a role label.

• No destructive errors are possible since this is a read-only display feature.
