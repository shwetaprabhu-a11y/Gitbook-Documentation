| **1. Product Summary** |

Loan Repayment is a core feature of the nFinia Digital Banking platform that enables credit union members to make payments on their loan accounts directly through the digital banking portal. This capability covers one-time payments, scheduled recurring payments, and multiple payment option types including regular payments, next-due-amount payments, payoff amounts, and pay-to-principal options — all accessible through the Transfer Funds to Own Account workflow.

Within the Summerville Federal Credit Union digital banking portal, Loan Repayment is accessible from the Account Details page of any loan account via the “Make Payment” link, or through Move Money \> Transfer Funds to Own Account by selecting a loan account as the destination. The feature integrates with the platform’s existing fund transfer infrastructure, providing a guided three-step workflow (Set up Transfer → Review → Finish) that ensures members can make informed payment decisions with clear confirmation at each stage.

For Summerville FCU, Loan Repayment reduces delinquency rates by making it effortless for members to stay current on their obligations. The self-service capability deflects routine payment inquiries from the contact center, while the recurring payment option promotes consistent repayment behavior. Members benefit from 24/7 payment access, flexible scheduling, and the ability to make additional principal payments to accelerate their payoff timeline.

| **3. End-to-End Workflow** |

**3.1 Prerequisites**

• Member must be enrolled in Summerville FCU digital banking with an active membership.

• The member must hold at least one active loan account (auto loan, personal loan, mortgage, etc.).

• The member must have a funded source account (checking or savings) from which to make the payment.

• Transfer permissions must be enabled for the member’s role (relevant for delegated access users).

**3.2 Step-by-Step Workflow**

**Step 1: View Loan Account Overview**

![01\_Loan-Accounts-Overview.png](/sessions/admiring-adoring-maxwell/mnt/SUMMERVILLE%20DOCS/Bill%20Pay,%20Loans,%20and%20Cards/Bill%20Pay%20and%20Loans/images/941cb6109ca40bea557207ec0807c5bc303d7582.png "Screenshot")

The member logs into the Summerville FCU digital banking portal and navigates to Accounts Overview, filtering by Loan Accounts. The overview displays each loan with its account name (e.g., “2019 BMW 0001”), Amount Due, Payment Due / Next Due Date, Payoff Amount, and quick action links including “History” and “Transfer Funds.” Overdue loans are highlighted with a red “Overdue” indicator and the next due date in red text.

**Step 2: View Loan Account Details**

![02\_Loan-Account-Details.png](/sessions/admiring-adoring-maxwell/mnt/SUMMERVILLE%20DOCS/Bill%20Pay,%20Loans,%20and%20Cards/Bill%20Pay%20and%20Loans/images/faeef6b4b3667130c900a8c85083cd8af8943042.png "Screenshot")

Clicking on the loan account opens the Account Details page, which provides a comprehensive view of the loan including Amount Due ($498.67), Payment Due / Next Due Date ($0.95 due on Oct 27, 2025), and links to “Make Payment,” “Skip-a-Pay,” and “See more.” Below the summary card, the Transactions section displays the full payment history with deposits, payment credits, and balance progression. The member clicks “Make Payment” to initiate the loan repayment workflow.

**Step 3: Set Up Transfer — Select Payment Option**

![03\_Transfer-Setup-Payment-Options.png](/sessions/admiring-adoring-maxwell/mnt/SUMMERVILLE%20DOCS/Bill%20Pay,%20Loans,%20and%20Cards/Bill%20Pay%20and%20Loans/images/419e72b26bfd162ab5880db184ed7f1c29b3e76d.png "Screenshot")

The Transfer Funds to Own Account screen opens with the three-step progress indicator (Set up Transfer → Review → Finish). Step 1 displays the From account (source checking/savings) and To account (the loan). The Payment Option dropdown provides four choices: Select (default), Next due amt, Payoff amount, Pay to principal, and Make a regular payment. The member also has the option to check “Make transfer recurring” to set up automated payments. The “Make this my preferred source account” checkbox allows saving the source account for future payments.

**Step 4: Enter Payment Amount and Date**

![04\_Transfer-Setup-Amount-Date.png](/sessions/admiring-adoring-maxwell/mnt/SUMMERVILLE%20DOCS/Bill%20Pay,%20Loans,%20and%20Cards/Bill%20Pay%20and%20Loans/images/10fe725cbd98588d807375aa0160fc96f3875611.png "Screenshot")

After selecting a payment option (e.g., “Make a regular payment”), the member enters the Amount to be transferred and an optional Transaction memo (limited to 23 characters). The Transfer Date field defaults to today’s date with a calendar picker for scheduling future payments. A “Make transfer recurring” checkbox is available for setting up automated payment schedules. The member clicks “Continue” to proceed to the review step.

**Step 5: Configure Recurring Payment (Optional)**

![05\_Transfer-Setup-Recurring.png](/sessions/admiring-adoring-maxwell/mnt/SUMMERVILLE%20DOCS/Bill%20Pay,%20Loans,%20and%20Cards/Bill%20Pay%20and%20Loans/images/edbb99947b19a2bbc25e91dd2a8f1a343140cc84.png "Screenshot")

When “Make transfer recurring” is checked, additional scheduling fields appear: Frequency (Weekly transfer, Bi-Weekly, Monthly, etc.), Repeat (Until end date, Number of times, Until cancelled), and End Date. The system displays a confirmation summary such as “Scheduled Weekly transfer, until April 15, 2026.” This enables members to automate their loan payments on a consistent schedule, reducing the risk of missed payments.

**Step 6: Review Transfer**

![06\_Transfer-Review.png](/sessions/admiring-adoring-maxwell/mnt/SUMMERVILLE%20DOCS/Bill%20Pay,%20Loans,%20and%20Cards/Bill%20Pay%20and%20Loans/images/dd6109a2a1574b388fad5f07085bfa600a88d76f.png "Screenshot")

The Review screen (Step 2 of 3) presents a complete summary of the payment: the transfer amount ($1.00), From account (PREFD C 0040 with available balance), To account (2019 BMW 0001), Transfer date, and recurring schedule details if applicable. The member can click “Back” to modify any details, “Cancel” to abort, or “Confirm Transfer” to submit the payment. This review step ensures the member has full visibility before committing.

**Step 7: Transfer Success**

![07\_Transfer-Success.png](/sessions/admiring-adoring-maxwell/mnt/SUMMERVILLE%20DOCS/Bill%20Pay,%20Loans,%20and%20Cards/Bill%20Pay%20and%20Loans/images/98f2b25b450f321bfa1599a03392160bc3a15a0b.png "Screenshot")

Upon successful submission, the Finish screen (Step 3 of 3) displays a green checkmark with “Successfully Sent” confirmation showing the transfer amount, source and destination accounts, and transfer date. A “Print” link allows the member to generate a receipt, and the “Done” button returns to the main banking view. The transaction is immediately recorded in the account’s transaction history.

**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

The Loan Repayment workflow includes several decision points:

• Payment Option Selection: Choosing “Next due amt” or “Payoff amount” auto-populates the amount field from the loan’s API data. “Pay to principal” directs the entire payment to principal reduction. “Make a regular payment” allows free-form amount entry.

• Recurring vs. One-Time: Checking “Make transfer recurring” expands the form to show Frequency, Repeat, and End Date fields. Unchecked, the payment processes as a single one-time transfer.

• Transfer Date: Members can schedule payments for today (immediate) or a future date using the calendar picker. Future-dated payments appear as scheduled transfers in the member’s queue.

• Source Account Selection: Members can choose from any eligible funded account. The “Make this my preferred source account” checkbox stores the selection for future loan payments.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

All loan payments conclude with a confirmation screen showing the transfer amount, source/destination accounts, and transfer date. For one-time payments, funds are debited immediately (or on the scheduled date). For recurring payments, the schedule is created and the first payment processes on the specified start date. Each transaction generates an audit log entry and appears in the loan account’s transaction history. Members can print a receipt from the success screen.

**3.5 Error Handling**

Common failure scenarios include: insufficient funds in the source account (displays balance error and prevents submission), amount exceeds payoff balance (validation error), invalid transfer date (past dates rejected), and system timeout during submission (retry option displayed). For scheduled recurring transfers, if a future payment fails due to insufficient funds, the system generates a failed transfer notification while subsequent scheduled payments continue.

| **6. Conclusion** |

Loan Repayment is a foundational self-service capability for Summerville Federal Credit Union’s digital banking offering on the nFinia platform. The feature addresses a critical member need by enabling convenient, flexible loan payments through the same Transfer Funds infrastructure used across the platform, ensuring a consistent and familiar user experience.

The guided three-step workflow (Set up Transfer → Review → Finish) with clear confirmation screens ensures members make informed payment decisions. The multiple payment options — next due amount, payoff, pay-to-principal, and regular payments — cater to diverse member needs, from minimum obligation fulfillment to accelerated debt reduction. The recurring payment capability is particularly valuable for reducing delinquency by automating consistent repayment schedules.

For Summerville FCU, Loan Repayment strengthens member retention by removing friction from the repayment process. Members who can easily manage their loan payments digitally are less likely to fall behind and more likely to remain engaged with the credit union for future lending needs. The feature reduces contact center volume for routine payment inquiries and provides full transaction audit trails that support the credit union’s operational and compliance requirements.
