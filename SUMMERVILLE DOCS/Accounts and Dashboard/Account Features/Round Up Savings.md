**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

-   **Single vs. Double Round-Up:** you's choice affects the transfer amount per transaction. Single rounds to the nearest dollar; double multiplies the round-up by 2. You can change this preference at any time after enrollment.

-   **Multiple Checking Accounts:** You with multiple checking accounts can set up separate round-up rules for each. The "Add Round Up to Savings for an account" option enables additional enrollments.

-   **Insufficient Funds:** If the checking account has insufficient funds to cover the round-up amount at the time of the debit card transaction, the system behavior is governed by the credit union's overdraft and courtesy pay settings.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

Upon successful activation, the system displays a confirmation banner: "Round Up to Savings preference saved successfully." The page transitions to show the active round-up configuration including the linked accounts, the selected rounding method, and a savings metrics dashboard.

![](/.gitbook/assets/0628f15cef1839e75ba9b49d9f077eb61eddaa09.png){width="6.041666666666667in" height="3.5416666666666665in"}

*Figure 8: Confirmation screen with savings metrics dashboard (MTD, YTD, Last Year, Total)*

The savings dashboard displays four key metrics: Month to Date savings, Year to Date savings, Last year savings, and Total savings. Below the metrics, the system confirms the selected rounding method (e.g., "Round Up amounts will be doubled and deposited into your selected savings account").

**3.5 Post-Enrollment Management**

Once enrolled, you can return to the Round Up to Savings page at any time to manage their preferences. The active configuration view displays the linked account pairing, savings metrics, and the current rounding method. Two action links are available: Edit (to modify the rounding method or linked accounts) and Remove (to deactivate the round-up rule).
