**1. Product Summary**

The FICO® Score Meter is a self-service credit monitoring feature within the nFinia digital banking platform that provides credit union members with free access to their FICO® Score directly from their online banking portal. The feature displays the member's current credit score, a visual score meter with industry-standard ranges (300--850), and personalized key factors that are influencing their score. This empowers members to monitor their credit health without needing third-party services or hard inquiries.

This feature serves all retail banking members who hold active accounts with Summerville Federal Credit Union. It is accessible under the Additional Services navigation path and requires no special enrollment---members simply navigate to the FICO Score page to view their latest score. The score is pulled periodically from Experian data using the FICO® Score 8 model, which is the same scoring model the credit union uses for lending decisions.

The FICO® Score Meter lives under Home \> Additional Services \> FICO Score in the nFinia platform. The page presents a visual dashboard with the member's numeric score, a color-coded meter graphic (green through red), key factors affecting the score with educational explanations, and a link to additional credit education resources. A FICO® Score History section below provides trend tracking over time.

-   Member must be authenticated and logged into the nFinia digital banking platform

**3.2 Step-by-Step Flow**

1.  **Start from the Dashboard:** After logging into the nFinia digital banking platform, the member lands on the Account Overview / Dashboard page. This screen displays account balances, membership details, quick transfer options, and upcoming payments. To access the FICO Score feature, the member navigates via the top navigation bar.

*Figure 3: FICO® Score Meter --- Score display with key factors and credit education*

4.  **Review Key Factors:** To the right of the score meter, the Key Factors section displays personalized explanations of what is affecting the member's score. Each factor includes a bold title and detailed explanation. Common factors include: (1) "Length of time accounts have been established" --- explains how the age of the oldest account and average account age impact the score, and (2) "Too few accounts currently paid as agreed" --- explains how missed payments or low number of accounts in good standing affect the score. Each factor includes a "Keep in mind" section with actionable guidance.

5.  **Access Credit Education:** At the bottom of the FICO Score card, the member can click "Click for more credit education" to access additional resources about credit building, score improvement strategies, and financial wellness content. This link redirects to educational materials provided through the credit bureau partnership.

6.  **View Score History:** Below the main FICO Score card, the "Your FICO® Score History" section displays a historical timeline of the member's score changes across multiple reporting periods. This allows the member to track trends, identify improvements or declines, and correlate score changes with financial behavior.

**3.3 Decision Points & Branching**

-   **No Credit File:** If the member does not have a reportable credit file with Experian, the system displays an informational message explaining that a FICO Score cannot be generated. The member is advised to contact the credit union for further assistance.

-   **Score Improvement vs. Decline:** The Key Factors section dynamically adjusts based on the member's current score profile. Members with declining scores see factors focused on areas needing improvement, while members with stable or improving scores see reinforcing factors.

-   **Multiple Memberships:** The FICO Score is tied to the member's credit profile (SSN-based), not individual accounts. Members with multiple memberships see the same score across all memberships.

**3.4 Completion & Confirmation**

The FICO Score page is a read-only informational display. There is no submission or confirmation step. The score updates automatically based on the credit bureau's reporting cycle (typically monthly). The "pulled on" date at the bottom of the score card confirms when the score was last refreshed. Members can return to this page at any time to check their current score without impacting their credit.

**3.5 Error Handling**

-   **Service Unavailable:** If the FICO Score service is temporarily unavailable or the credit bureau data feed is interrupted, the page displays an appropriate error message and advises the member to try again later.

-   **Score Not Available:** For new members or members without sufficient credit history, the system explains that a score cannot be generated and provides guidance on building credit.

-   **Data Refresh Delay:** If the score has not been updated within the expected cycle, the "pulled on" date helps the member and support staff identify whether a refresh is pending.
