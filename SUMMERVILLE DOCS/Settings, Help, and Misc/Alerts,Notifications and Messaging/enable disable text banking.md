## 1. Product Summary

Text Banking is a lightweight, SMS-based channel that allows Summerville Credit Union members to query account information and perform basic banking actions by sending short text commands to a dedicated short code (28640). Once enabled, members do not need the mobile app or a web browser — they send a text message and receive a real-time response. This is particularly valuable for members in low-connectivity environments or those who prefer a frictionless interaction model over launching a full digital banking session.

The feature is managed entirely within the nFinia mobile app under **More Options > Text Banking**. Members can toggle Text Banking on or off, select which registered phone number to associate with the service, and view the full library of supported text commands — all from a single screen. The platform enforces OTP-based authentication before any changes to Text Banking settings take effect, ensuring that the channel cannot be hijacked without access to a verified device.

For Summerville CU, Text Banking extends service reach without increasing call center volume. Members who would otherwise call the branch to check a balance can self-serve via SMS in seconds. The feature also supports member retention in segments that are less engaged with the full mobile banking app but remain active via basic text messaging.

## 2. Use Cases

| Use Case | Who Uses It | What They Do | Business Value |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Enable Text Banking for the first time | Retail member | Navigates to More Options > Text Banking, toggles the feature on, selects a registered phone number, and taps Update | Member gains SMS-based account access without requiring mobile app for routine balance checks |
| Disable Text Banking | Retail member | Navigates to More Options > Text Banking, toggles the feature off, and taps Update | Member can turn off the channel at will, reducing security exposure if a phone is lost or transferred |
| Switch the associated phone number | Retail member | Selects a different number from the dropdown (populated from registered contacts on profile) and taps Update | Ensures text commands are sent/received on the correct current device |
| Check account balance via SMS | Retail member (with Text Banking enabled) | Texts **SV BAL** to 28640 | Instant balance retrieval with no app login required; reduces inbound support calls |
| View command list via SMS | Any member unsure of syntax | Texts **SV HELP** to 28640 | Self-service discovery of available commands; reduces member friction and support load |
| FI operations — member cannot authenticate | Credit union member services rep | Member calls in; rep confirms registered phone numbers on file match what member expects | Ensures the phone number registry is accurate and the OTP verification chain is intact |

These use cases reflect the range of interactions Summerville CU members will encounter across the Text Banking lifecycle — from initial setup through day-to-day use. For the credit union, the channel's value compounds as adoption grows: each member who self-serves a balance inquiry via SMS is a call that never reaches the contact center.

## 3. End-to-End Workflow

### 3.1 Prerequisites

- Member must have an active Summerville Credit Union retail membership with nFinia digital banking access.
- At least one phone number must be registered on the member's profile. The Text Banking screen populates the phone number dropdown from the member's profile on file; if no number is registered, the member must update their personal information first.
- The member must have the Summerville nFinia mobile app installed and be able to complete OTP authentication (i.e., have access to one of the registered phone numbers or call options).

---

### 3.2 Step-by-Step Flow — Enable Text Banking

**Step 1 — Launch the App (Welcome Screen)**

The member opens the Summerville nFinia mobile app. The Welcome screen presents options to Enroll, Log In, access Accounts/Move Money/Check Deposit/Manage Devices as a guest, or check a quick Balance.

![Welcome Screen](images/Welcome_Screen_1.jpeg)

---

**Step 2 — Log In**

The member taps **Log In** and enters their Username and Password. "Remember me" is available to persist the username. The member taps the **Log In** button to proceed.

![Log In Screen](images/Log_In_Screen_2.jpeg)

---

**Step 3 — Select Authentication Method (Verification)**

The system triggers an OTP challenge. The member is presented with all registered phone numbers and can choose to receive a **Text** or a **Call** to any of them. The member selects their preferred delivery method.

> *Note: If the member does not see their updated contact information, a **Refresh** link is available to reload the phone number list from the profile.*

![Verification — Select Authentication Method](images/Verification___Select_Authentication_Method_3.jpeg)

---

**Step 4 — Enter OTP (User Verification)**

A one-time passcode is sent to the selected number. The member enters the passcode in the field provided and taps **Submit**. A retry timer (58 seconds) is displayed — if the code does not arrive, the member must wait before requesting a new one.

![User Verification — OTP Entry](images/User_Verification___OTP_Entry_4.jpeg)

---

**Step 5 — Dashboard**

Upon successful authentication, the member lands on the Dashboard, which shows a personalized greeting, Credit Score & Offers, and an overview of all accounts with total deposits and outstanding loans.

![Dashboard](images/Dashboard_5.jpeg)

---

**Step 6 — Open the Side Menu**

The member taps the hamburger menu icon (top right) to open the navigation drawer. The menu displays the member's name, last login timestamp, and options including Statements & eNotices, Digital Wallet, Help, **More Options**, My Insights, Feedback, Stop Check Payment, and My Offers.

![Side Menu](images/Side_Menu_6.jpeg)

---

**Step 7 — Navigate to More Options**

The member taps **More Options** in the side menu. The More Options screen lists: Contact us, Branch and ATM, Card fraud alerts, Disclosures and agreement, **Text banking**, and Close Account. The member taps **Text banking**.

![More Options](images/More_Options_7.jpeg)

---

**Step 8 — Enable Text Banking**

The Text Banking screen loads. The member:
1. Taps the toggle next to **Text banking** to switch it **ON** (toggle turns green; label changes to "Text banking is enabled").
2. Confirms or selects the desired phone number from the dropdown (e.g., (+1) 224-698-9201).
3. Taps **Update**.

The system displays a confirmation toast: **"Text Banking has now been enabled."**

The screen also displays the short code (**28640**) and the supported text commands for immediate reference.

### 3.2b Step-by-Step Flow — Disable Text Banking

The navigation path to reach the Text Banking screen is identical (Steps 1–7 above). The only difference is in Step 8:

**Step 8 — Disable Text Banking**

On the Text Banking screen, the toggle is currently **ON** (green). The member:
1. Taps the toggle to switch it **OFF** (toggle turns grey; label changes to "Text banking is disabled").
2. Taps **Update**.

The system displays a confirmation toast: **"Text Banking has now been disabled."**

---

### 3.3 Decision Points & Branching

- **Toggle state on load**: If Text Banking is already enabled, the member arrives on the Text Banking screen with the toggle in the ON position. The workflow to disable is the mirror image of enabling.
- **Phone number selection**: The dropdown is pre-populated with all phone numbers registered on the member's profile. If the member has only one number, it is pre-selected. If multiple numbers exist, the member must confirm the correct one before tapping Update.
- **Adding a new number**: A **+ Add a new number** link is available on the Text Banking screen. This redirects to personal information settings where a new number can be registered. The member must complete that flow before returning to Text Banking to select the new number.
- **OTP failure**: If the member enters an incorrect OTP, the system does not grant access to settings. The member may retry after the countdown timer expires.

---

### 3.4 Completion & Confirmation

Upon tapping **Update** with a valid toggle state and phone number selected, the platform:
- Updates the Text Banking enrollment status in the member's profile.
- Displays an inline toast notification confirming the action ("Text Banking has now been enabled." or "Text Banking has now been disabled.").
- If enabled: the member can immediately begin texting commands to 28640 from the registered number.
- If disabled: any subsequent texts from the previously registered number to 28640 will receive no response or an "inactive" reply.

---

### 3.5 Error Handling

| Scenario | What the Member Sees | Resolution |
|----------|----------------------|------------|
| OTP not received | "Didn't receive your code? Retry in 58s" countdown | Wait for timer to expire, then retry or select a different delivery method (Call) |
| No phone number on profile | Dropdown empty; Update button may be inactive | Member must add a phone number via personal information settings |
| Incorrect OTP entered | Error state on OTP entry; access to settings denied | Re-enter correct code or request a new one after countdown |
| Session timeout | Member returned to login screen | Re-authenticate with username/password and complete OTP again |
